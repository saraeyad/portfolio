          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a 21-year-old passionate learner with a love for both technology
            and sports. After graduating from high school with a 99% average, I
            followed my dream and joined Al-Azhar University to study
            programming , a field I truly found myself in. <br />

            I’ve built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
            recently started exploring React , I enjoy creating responsive,
            visually engaging user interfaces and solving real problems through
            code.
            <br />I also enjoy coding challenges and continuously push myself to
            grow both technically and personally. Outside of tech, I’m an
            athlete at heart,I’ve competed in volleyball and table tennis
            tournaments, proudly winning several championships across the Gaza
            Strip. <br />
            Whether I’m coding or competing, I bring the same energy: passion,
            persistence, and a desire to make a difference.
          </p>

          <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
          <p>3rd-year student at Al-Azhar University<br />GPA: 94.87%</p>

          <h3>WHY I APPLY TO THIS COURSE?</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past couple of months, I’ve been dedicating my time to
            learning React, after building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Through this journey, I realized how passionate I am
            about front-end development. That’s why I see this training as a
            truly valuable opportunity — not only to strengthen my technical
            skills and explore both React and Angular more deeply, but also to
            gain insights I wouldn’t get from self-study, especially about the
            job market and real-world expectations. I’m excited about the chance
            to learn, grow, and connect with others in the field.
